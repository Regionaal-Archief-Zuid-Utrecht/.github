Welcome to the Github page of the Regional Archive Zuid-Utrecht (RAZU). 
RAZU is a municipal collaboration of the municipalities of Bunnik, Houten, Rhenen, Utrechtse Heuvelrug, Vijfheerenlanden, and Wijk bij Duurstede. Its main tasks are:

▪ implement the Dutch archival law, which means overseeing the quality and legality of municipal information management, ensuring the durability, reliability, and accessibility of the permanently preserved municipal archives, and serving as the front office for people who wish to view documents; 
▪ provide a knowledge and information center on local and regional history by building and managing as broad a collection of historical sources as possible, and ensuring that as many people as possible can enjoy and make use of it.

RAZU not only considers its archives (data) to be open and reusable, it strives to make use of- and develop primarly open source software. Thus, on this Github page you will find our open source, free to use code.
